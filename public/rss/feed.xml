            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This course covers all Mathematics needed to become Software Developer. Here we will discuss Linear Algebra, Modern Analysis, Mathematical Logic, Number Theory and Discrete Mathematics. By the end of this course you will be able to analyze and describe computer science concepts and methods. This course is a great opportunity for you to gain deep understanding of all processes a executed in the computer system when programming. The specific objectives of the course are the following:Learn how to apply proof techniques to your computer program. Learn encrypting and decrypting messages with Number Theory. Learn how the software development is related to Discrete Mathematics and Digital Electronics. Understand how to use mathematical tools to properly analyze any computer algorithm.Learn how to apply Calculus, Probability Theory and Linear Algebra while computing. Understand how to apply Lambda Calculus to Functional Programming. Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics." Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.Who this course is for:Beginner Java DevelopersBeginner Python DevelopersBeginner C & C++ DevelopersComputer Science StudentsEngineering StudentsEmployees in Programming Companies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[BeschreibungWir bauen dieses Praxisprojekt Schritt für Schritt auf und du kannst alle Codes zu jedem Kapitel downloaden. Frustfreies Entwickeln ist somit garantiert!Alle Codes für ESP32 als auch für den ESP8266 anwendbarIn diesem Videokurs lernst du die Ansteuerung einer 8x32 LED-Matrix (bzw. eines MAX72xx Moduls). Wir verwenden für dieses Projekt die MD_Parola-Bibliothek. Damit lässt sich der Text auf verschiedenste Weise steuern. Mit dieser Bibliothek haben wir die Möglichkeit verschiedenste Laufschrift-Einstellungen einfach und schnell umsetzen zu können. Es kann ein Text von der einen Seite hinein gleiten und in der Mitte der Matrix für eine gewisse Zeit stehen bleiben. Die Einblenddauer lässt sich zeitlich regeln und auch die Geschwindigkeit, Helligkeit von der Laufschrift kann man einfach anpassen.Wir werden ebenfalls Punkt-Grafiken einfügen, welche den Text “verschwinden” lassen, sobald die Grafik über den Text gleitet.Wir werden in dem Kurs mittels einen lokalen Webserver, welcher auf dem ESP32/8266 läuft, eine Website erstellen. Der Webserver wird so konfiguriert, dass du mittels einer fixen IP-Adresse auf die eigens erstellte Website zugreifen kannst. Auf der Website befindet sich ein Input-Feld in dem du einen Text hinterlegen kannst. Mittels jQuery senden wir einen GET-Request zum Arduino, welcher den Inhalt auswertet und auf der LED-Matrix ausgibt. Somit kannst du individuell den Text über den Webserver steuern.Der Text wie auch die Website-Daten werden mittels SPIFFS auf dem ESP hinterlegt. Das ist der Flash-Speicher vom Arduino. Dadurch kann nach jedem öffnen auch der aktuelle Text auf der Website angezeigt werden. Mittels Speicherung auf dem Flash-Speicher kann also auch jede Person/Endgerät welches die Website aufruft den gerade aktuellen ausgegebenen Text auf der LED-Matrix sehen. Somit könnte man auch eine größere Werbefläche via Webserver gestalten. Würde der Arduino vom Strom getrennt werden, wäre der Inhalt der Ausgabe nicht verschwunden und würde beim nächsten Verbinden der Stromquelle den Text automatisch wieder ausgeben.Ebenfalls werden wir die lokale Uhrzeit anzeigen. Dazu verbinden wir uns zu einem NTP-Server und laden den aktuellen Zeitstempel herunter. Dieses Timestamp wandeln wir in ein lesbares Datum/Uhrzeit um.Zu guter letzt laden wir uns von einer öffentlichen Schnittstelle noch den aktuellen Bitcoin Preis herunter. Somit lernst du, wie du öffentliche APIs mit dem Arduino ansteuern und den Rückgabewert mittels Arduino JSON auswertest.Nach jedem Video habe ich meinen Zwischenstand von der Programmierung abgespeichert. Du kannst alle Codes herunterladen, sodass du frustfrei zum Ergebnis kommst.Wir verbauen in diesem Praxisprojekt folgende Komponenten.ESP32/ESP8266MAX7219 8x32 LED-MatrixStep-down-Modul für externe 12v Spannungsversorgung (optional)Wir sehen uns im KurspixelEDIFür wen eignet sich dieser Kurs:An alle DIY-Enthusiasten und Hobby-Entwickler die mit der Arduino-Plattform entwickelnMehr zeigenWeniger zeigen]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Varṇam is a type of composition in the Carnatic music system consisting of short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features (patterns of notes) of a raga.Varnams capture the raga bhavam, ranjaka prayogas visesha sancharas, etc. Dhatu and Janta prayogas (phrase usage) are usually part of a Varnam. Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a pallavi, an anupallavi, muktaayi swaras, a charanam, and chittaswaras. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.Types of varnamsNamed for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, tana varnams only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.With rhythmic elements like a padam, pada varnams are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the tana varnam which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a pada varnam also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, pada varnams contain more lyrical content than a tana varnam.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.Padajathi varnams are simply pada varnams that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.Contents of a varnamThe name "varnam" (meaning "letter") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.The varnam is subdivided into several sections:Pallavi: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.Anupallavi: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.Muktaayi: Sung completely with syllables—or swaras -- (like s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.Charanam: Sung with lyricsChitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.Anubandham: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, Adi Tala (8 beat cycle) and Ata Tala (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the Adi Tala Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice.Famous varnamsAdi Tala Varnams include:"Sami Ninne" in Shree ragam composed by Karur Devudu Iyer in Telugu"Ninnukori" in Mohanam ragam by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu"Evvari Bodhana" in Abhogi ragam by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu"Era Naapai" in Todi raagam by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu"Valachi Vacchi" in Navaraagamalika in Telugu (9 ragas, similar to Ragamalika which literally translates to a garland of ragamsAta Tala Varnams include:"Viriboni" in Bhairavi ragam by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu"Nera Nammiti" in Kaanada raagam by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu"Chalamela" in Sankarabharanam by Swati Tirunal in TeluguThe Arabhi ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.The "Mathe Malayadhwaja" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancersWho this course is for:Those who are curious to learn Classical Carnatic Music.Students who have learnt the basics of Classical Music.Students who want to know the Key tips of practicing.]]></content:encoded>

Second section of the course covers this part.Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning modelProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in PythonUnderstanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.Why use Python for data Machine Learning?Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history: In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions. In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools. In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.Who this course is for:People pursuing a career in data scienceWorking Professionals beginning their Data journeyStatisticians needing more practical experienceAnyone curious to master Decision Tree technique from Beginner to Advanced in short span of time]]></content:encoded>

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine LearningHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts.

While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.Who this course is for:People pursuing a career in data scienceWorking Professionals beginning their Data journeyStatisticians needing more practical experienceAnyone curious to master Linear and Logistic Regression from beginner to advanced level in a short span of time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the super-competitive real estate market, Realtors need every advantage they can get.Don't you hate it when a potential client that you spoke with months ago, buys or sells their home... and uses another agent?Imagine, for a minute, that you had the undivided attention of your ideal prospect. And not only that, you were talking in their ear on a weekly basis. Maybe, they aren't ready to sell their home or buy a new one this week, but what about next week, next month, next year.If you can remain top-of-mind with your clients and position yourself as the "One and Only" Realtor for them to turn to, regardless of when they decide to buy or sell, what would that do to your business?Everyone has a smartphone. Everyone in your farm could be listening to your online radio show or Podcast.What is a Podcast? It is audio or video shows, that when you subscribe to them, are automatically updated on your Computer, Smartphones, iPads, Tablets, and/or iPods. Think of them as free radio or TV shows which you deliver Spam-Free! directly to your audience every time you produce one.Podcasting is bigger than you think. When we survey people who listen to free, commercial-free audio Podcasts at least once a month: we discover an interesting fact: It beats AM/FM Radio, streaming audio, CD's, TV Music channels, & Sirius!If you compare the number of people listening to Podcasts monthly, they are as popular as Twitter with 39 mIllion listeners, even if it doesn't get the same 'Respect'.But instead of communicating in impersonal 140 character Tweets, with Podcasting, you get right into the head of your target market for as long as you talk.Podcasts are portable — and because of this, they are listened to everywhere... in the car, walking the dog, at the gym, at the beach, on a plane, anywhere.When you claim your seat in this course, you'll have permanent online access to watch the course 24/7, and there's a Q&A discussion section by each lecture, where you can post questions - and we'll answer them personally!By following the short, simple, easy-to-follow lectures, you will be able to work through the process of setting up your show and publishing your first episode quickly.Podcasting is increasing in popularity, and thanks to CarPlay, Google jumping on Podcasts and Apps, Podcast will continue growing for years to come. It is just past the 'Early Adopter' stage and has huge potential moving forward. Don't miss out on the low-competition, high-demand opportunities that your fellow Real Estate Podcasters are enjoying.Your co-instructor, Scott Paton, has over 10,000 Podcast students on Udemy. Your other co-instructor, MO, or Michael Oden, is moderator of the 19,000 strong Facebook group, Lab Coat Agents.

As legend tells it, years ago there was a penetration test in an isolated environment where the assessment team was not able to bring in any computers or have network access in or out of the target environment. In order to do the work, the first penetration testing distribution was born. It was a bootable Live CD configured with various tools needed to do the work, and after the assessment was completed the Live CD was shared online and became very popular.Kali Linux has a direct lineage from this original distribution, running on through BackTrack Linux, and now is Kali Linux.What are the makings of a great penetration testing distribution? What a penetration testing distribution is judged on has changed over the years. Originally it was just how many tools did it hold. Then it was did it have package management, and how often were they updated? As we have matured, so has the features that we need to provide. The true indication of a great Penetration Testing distribution is the selection of useful and relevant features that it offers security professionals. What kind of features are we talking about? We’re happy you asked! We’ve made a short list of some of these Kali Linux features, and linked them to their respective sources.Who this course is for:Beginners to Kali Linux]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Everything you need to Know about Blogger From Beginning to Advance | Free Udemy Course]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,In this course you are going to see how to be a blogger from scratch with no cost.....Here we will be using a website called Blogger to create our blogs and publish it for free.In this course I will be showing you all the tools available on Blogger which you can use.....Google Blogger–also just called Blogger–is an online content management system (CMS) that facilitates the creation of informal online discussion sites, also called blogs. Users can get a free blogspot com domain or buy a custom domain.Users can also customize their blogs with different templates, flexible layouts, and hundreds of background images. In order to use Blogger, users must create a Google account. (Individuals with existing Gmail email addresses can use this account.) Users can customize the name of their account; the format is displayed as name.blogspot com. Users are also able to create multiple blogs under one account.Content is hosted on Cloud Spanner, Google's database service that was released in 2017. Blogger is also integrated with other Google programs, such as Google AdSense and Google Analytics. Users can use Google AdSense to automatically display relevant targeted ads so that users are able to make money through their own Google Blogger site.Users must sign up for an AdSense account separately, and then link advertisements to their individual blogs. Not all blogs qualify for advertisements, so interested users should double-check the eligibility checklist. Blogger has its own built-in analytics tools that help users identify where their audience is coming from and what they’re interested in. Users can also connect their blog directly to Google Analytics for more detailed information.Users control the features of Blogger through the program's dashboard. The dashboard displays the blog's activity, news from Google, or any updates to the program. Users can manage a particular blog by clicking the blog title and editing it. They can also create new posts from the dashboard. Blogger websites can be viewed and accessed from a desktop or a mobile platform. Users can email their posts to your blog; with email posting, you can use your mobile device to post to your blog. The mobile application Blogger Mobile allows users to post pictures directly to their Blogger account from their mobile device.Although there are blogging tools with more complex and sophisticated features available, the fact that Blogger is free and offers some level of customization for users makes it an attractive system for individuals who may be novices at blogging.When Blogger was first started by Pyra Labs in 1999, it was one of the first blog-publishing tools on the Internet. It was founded by Evan Williams, one of the co-founders of Twitter, and Meg Hourihan, one of the co-founders of Kinja. The company has been credited with helping to popularize the blog format of sharing content on the Internet.Google acquired Blogger in 2003 when it purchased Pyra Labs for an undisclosed amount of money. After the acquisition, the CMS underwent a major redesign in 2004 and some of Blogger's premium services became free.Who this course is for:Beginners in Blog CreationBeginners to BloggerThose who want to create their first blog]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide!This course offers a comprehensive overview of the RSpec testing library for the Ruby programming language. RSpec is the most popular Ruby Gem of all time, with over 300 million downloads to date.If you're new to the topic, testing is the practice of "writing code that confirms that other code works as expected". Tests control for regressions, which are changes to the code that break the program. Tests give you the confidence to refactor existing code because you know that you will honor the original purpose of the code. The benefits of testing extend outside of your codebase. In this course, we'll cover test-driven development (TDD), a methodology in which we write our tests first, before the implementation. Test-driven development often leads to simpler, more decoupled code. Thus, testing can make you a better developer. Tests force you to think critically about the program and its features: the classes, the objects, the methods and more.Testing Ruby with RSpec begins with the RSpec essentials and proceeds to more complex topics including:InstallationProject InitializationTest-Driven Development (TDD)let variablesbefore and after HooksSubjectsShared ExamplesShared ContextBuilt-in MatchersMocks and DoublesInstance DoublesClass DoublesAs a software engineer and consultant who's worked with Ruby for 5+ years, I'm excited to introduce you to the awesome RSpec library, its elegant syntax, and all of its fun quirks.Thanks for checking out the course!Who this course is for:Intermediate Ruby developers interested in upgrading their skill setProgrammers who want to explore the fundamentals of testing and TDD]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Graph AI carries immense potential for us to explore, connect the dots and build intelligent applications using the Internet of Behaviors (IoB). Many Graph Neural Networks achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their area to the students. The purpose of this course is to unfold the basics to the cutting-edge concepts and technologies in this realm.Graphs are all around us; real-world objects are often defined in terms of their connections to other things. A set of objects, and the connections between them, are naturally expressed as a Graph Neural Network (GCN). Recent developments have increased their capabilities and expressive power. They have profound applications in the realm of AI, fake news detection, traffic prediction to recommendation systems.This course explores and explains modern AI graph neural networks. In this course, we look at what kind of data is most naturally phrased as a graph, and some common examples. Then we explore what makes graphs different from other types of data, and some of the specialized choices we have to make when using graphs. We then build a modern GNN, walking through each of the parts of the model and gradually to state-of-the-art AI GNN models. Finally, we provide a GNN playground where you can play around with a real-world task and dataset to build a stronger intuition of how each component of an AI GNN model contributes to the predictions it makes. The topics of this course include:1. Introduction to Graph Machine Learning.2. Internet of Behaviors.3. Homographic Intelligence.4. Graphs Basics and Eigen Centrality.4. Graph Neural Networks.5. Graph Attention Networks.6. Building a Graph Neural Network7. GNNs Predictors by Pooling Information.8. Graph AI and its code implementations in Python.9. Multi- Graphs and Hyper- Graphs in AI using IoB.10. Design Space for a GNNs.11. Inductive Biases in GNNs.12. Pytorch Geometric Implementations.13. Node2Vec Feature Learning.14. FAST GCNs.15. Gated Graph RNNs.16. Graph LSTMs17. Mixed Grain Aggregators.18. Multimodal Graph AI.19. 100+ Resources on Graph Neural Networks Who this course is for:Beginner and intermediate learners in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligenceResearch Students in the realm of data science, big data analytics, Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Open RAN (O-RAN, ORAN) and Private 4G / 5G NetworksIn this course, you will mainly learn two things: 1) Learn the Open RAN Concepts, Architectures, Interfaces, and the details related to them.2) Learn how to build 4G & 5G networks using open-source Open RAN software and general-purpose, COTS hardware.If you want to prepare yourself to build practical, and fully open telecom equipment, software programs, and end-to-end 4G/5G systems alternative and competitive to those produced by conventional Telecom companies, such as NOKIA, HUAWEI, SAMSUNG, ERICSSON, ZTE, etc., or want to learn how to build private 4G/5G networks, then this course is just for you. In this course, you will learn in detail most technical aspects of building end-to-end 4G and 5G systems including eNodeB/gNodeB, UE, and EPC/5GC.Private networks, no matter who you ask (see: here, here, or here) have transitioned from lab toys to a multi-billion dollar industry. Open source too has left the lab and solutions from the likes of RedHat, OpenStack, O-RAN Alliance, and the Telecom Infra Project are a growing presence in operators’ networks globally. As the footprint of open source grows, and network operators see the benefits of deploying open source, the industry is responding by developing open source solutions moving up the stack. Now with the introduction of the Magma project, open-source is moving into complex network functions like the core of the 4G and 5G mobile networks.Dumping gas on the open and private network fire, the FCC has made available commercially deployable CBRS spectrum that we see taking off in the recent auction and as Spectrum Access Systems (SASs) go live. With its 3-tier access, CBRS means anyone can get a meaningful chunk of airwaves with 25 times (or more) the power of most Wi-Fi networks to deliver high-quality wireless services.In light of these changes, in this version of the build your own network how-to, I will move our target from a lab network to a commercial-grade LTE network deployment. Let’s get started.After you complete watching all the lecture videos of the course, you will get a professional certificate of completion.Who this course is for:Anyone interested in learning about Open RAN and how to practically build private 4G and 5G networks can join the course]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[**Course Updated - July 2022**>> COURSE REGULARLY UPDATED: NEW TIPS, MORE LESSONS <<>> CERTIFIED COACH, SPEAKER AND TRAINER <<>> OVER 180,000 STUDENTS IN TOTAL <<Preparing for an interview takes a lot more than Googling a list of common interview questions. You have to make a great first impression, you will have to have a great knowledge of your target company and its product, and, of course, know exactly how to convey that you're the perfect fit for the job.There is no one “best” way to prepare for an interview. Rather, there are specific and important strategies to enhance one’s chances for interview success. Every interview is a learning experience. Learning that takes place during the preparation and actual interview process is useful for future interviewsThe interview is one of the most important elements in the job search process. When an employer invites you to an interview, he/she is indicating an interest in bringing you on board. The interview gives both of you the opportunity to exchange enough information to determine if you are a good "fit" for each other.The biggest mistake in interviewing is not being fully prepared. It behooves job-seekers to use every conceivable means possible to prepare for the interview and to allow ample time to fully prepare.Understand that interviewing is a skill; as with all skills, preparation and practice enhance the quality of that skill. Preparation can make the difference between getting an offer and getting rejected. You should use the limited amount of time you have to learn about an employer's needs and discuss the ways you can meet these needs.Think of an interview as a highly focused professional conversation. In many cases, you will interview at least twice before being hired for a position. Once in a brief screening interview and at least once again in a more serious meeting when you may also speak with many of your potential co-workers.Who this course is for:This course is for everyone who wants to work towards getting their dream jobThis Course is NOT for those looking for shortcut to success. You will have to be able to work for your own success]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn how to build APIs from scratch using the Python based libraries Flask and FastAPI. You will build plenty of applications and tools such as word dictionary and a google search page based solely on API obtained data. The course assumes no prior programming experience. We will provide you with two introductory sections for Python where you will learn all the basics before moving to the API building lessons. API stands for Application Programming Interface, a software-to-software interface that enables two applications to exchange data among each other. Each time we use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on our phone, we’re using an API. Simply put, when we use an application on our mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends us the information we wanted in a readable way — all of this happens via API.APIs can be a service for developers. Every time developers write a new program, they don’t have to start from scratch to build a core application that tries to do everything. Instead, they can contract out certain responsibilities by using already created pieces that do the job better.Who this course is for:Software EngineersComputer Science StudentsComplete Beginners who want to learn API Development]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This course will cover the concepts of forecasting and budgeting from a finance perspective.The course includes many example problems, both in presentation form, and many using Excel worksheets. Each Excel worksheet problem will include a downloadable Excel worksheet that has at least two tabs, one having the answer, the second including a preformatted worksheet that can be populated in a step-by-step process along with the instructional video.To forecast and budget we need to make predictions and projections about the future. This is often done by first taking information from the past as our starting point. The starting point will generally be our prior financial statements, including our prior balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.We will then consider changes that we expect to take place, including those we plan on making and changes to the economy and business environment.When constructing our budgets will need to go in a systematic order. We usually need to start with a sales projection because other projections will depend on it.Our budget process can then consider the production plan. We can then move to the capital budget, cash budget, and budgeted income statement. The budgeted income statement is our primary performance statement.Once we have the beginning balance sheet and the projected income statement, we can create the projected balance sheet, the statement representing where we expect to be at the end of the budgeted time frame.Who this course is for:StudentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this course we will cover the concepts of leverage and break-even analysis from a corporate finance perspective.Leverage is a critical component of decision making in corporate finance and is an area of debate as to the optimal amount of leverage. Finding the best level of leverage may allow a business to grow much faster.We will discuss the concepts of operating leverage, financial leverage, and combined leverage and include practical practice problems related to these critical concepts. Break-even analysis is a fundamental tool in decision making. Learners will understand the concept of break-even analysis, including the tool of breaking costs up by their behavior, labeling them fixed costs and variable costs. Labeling costs by category of fixed and variable can seem unnatural at first, because we often label costs by function, what the cost is designed to do, like operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Labeling cost by behavior helps us see how the cost changes with relation to increases in production level, a useful concept for projecting into the future. The course will show how to calculate the break-even point and the cash break-even point. We will also discuss the concept of nonlinear break-even analysis.This course will include many practice problems, often including downloadable Excel worksheets. Each Excel worksheet will have at least to tabs, one with the answer, one with a preformatted worksheet that learners can populate along with step-by-step instructional videos.Who this course is for:StudentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

Accounting is generally using past data to construct the financial statements in accordance with accounting standards. The financial statements are critical to the field of corporate finance but the the focus is different.

We will be able to list and discuss different forms of business organizations.Learners will understand the primary financial statements including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. The financial statements are one of the primary tools used in corporate finance. They are generated from past data and we use then to make predictions about future performance. The balance sheet tells us where we stand at a point in time, while the income statement gives us an idea of performance over a time range. This course will include many practice problem examples, including examples using Excel worksheets. Excel worksheets will be provided that generally have at least two tabs, one with the answer, the other being preformatted allowing learners to work the practice problems in a step-by-step format along with instructional videos.Who this course is for:StudentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

On January 11, 2020, China declared first death of their 61 years old citizen due to COVID‐19, who was exposed to the seafood market (WHO, 2020b), but now death reached exponentially to 357,736 on 29th May 2020 (WHO, 2020a).On February 11, 2020, WHO announced this coronavirus disease as COVID‐19 (WHO, 2020c) and pandemic on March 11, 2020, after reaching the virus infection to 114 countries across the world.COVID‐19 and SARS coronavirus are similar and because it is becoming a big threat to human civilization as consequences, online awareness programs were initiated and conducted worldwide by WHO (2020c).Proper strategies and funds were set up by WHO globally to protect the countries with special focus to poor and weaker health infrastructure developing countries. The aim was to reduce the virus communication in society, dissemination of crucial information, providing proper healthcare and to minimize social and economical loss. WHO also focused on establishing an easy and effective diagnostic system to prevent infection (WHO 2020 c).To prevent the infection socially, the lockdown was imposed globally, which resulted in the halt of all economic and social activity in society. This led to cease global supply chains badly resulting in the global economy in bad shape. All transport, manufacturing, hotel industry, educational sector, service industry and so forth were closed immediately, people were left to remain as to where they were at the time of lockdown announcement and during lockdown people started working from home, school and colleges classes are running online, a large number of people shifted on a digital platform.But on May 30, 2020, this situation of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) outbreak has become worse, as it contains 5,704,736 confirmed cases, 357,736 confirmed deaths across 216 countries.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[To understand how organizations like Google, Amazon, and even Udemy use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract meaning and insights from enormous data sets, this machine learning course will provide you with the essentials. According to Glassdoor and Indeed, data scientists earn an average income of $120,000, and that is just the norm! When it comes to being attractive, data scientists are already there. In a highly competitive job market, it is tough to keep them after they have been hired. People with a unique mix of scientific training, computer expertise, and analytical abilities are hard to find.Like the Wall Street "quants" of the 1980s and 1990s, modern-day data scientists are expected to have a similar skill set. People with a background in physics and mathematics flocked to investment banks and hedge funds in those days because they could come up with novel algorithms and data methods.That being said, data science is becoming one of the most well-suited occupations for success in the twenty-first century. It is computerized, programming-driven, and analytical in nature. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that the need for data scientists has been increasing in the employment market over the last several years.The supply, on the other hand, has been quite restricted. It is challenging to get the knowledge and abilities required to be recruited as a data scientist.In this course, mathematical notations and jargon are minimized, each topic is explained in simple English, making it easier to understand. Once you've gotten your hands on the code, you'll be able to play with it and build on it. The emphasis of this course is on understanding and using these algorithms in the real world, not in a theoretical or academic context. You'll walk away from each video with a fresh idea that you can put to use right away!All skill levels are welcome in this course, and even if you have no prior statistical experience, you will be able to succeed!Who this course is for:Anyone who want to pursue a career in Machine LearningAny Python programming enthusiast willing to add machine learning proficiency to their portfolioTechnologists who are curious about how Machine Learning works in the real worldProgrammers who are looking to add machine learning to their skillset]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Complete PEP8 Professional Python Coding Course covers the PEP 8 document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.PEP 8 exists to improve the readability of Python code. But why is readability so important? Why is writing readable code one of the guiding principles of the Python language?As Guido van Rossum said, “Code is read much more often than it is written.” You may spend a few minutes, or a whole day, writing a piece of code to process user authentication. Once you’ve written it, you’re never going to write it again. But you’ll definitely have to read it again. That piece of code might remain part of a project you’re working on. Every time you go back to that file, you’ll have to remember what that code does and why you wrote it, so readability matters.If you’re new to Python, it can be difficult to remember what a piece of code does a few days, or weeks, after you wrote it. If you follow PEP 8, you can be sure that you’ve named your variables well. You’ll know that you’ve added enough whitespace so it’s easier to follow logical steps in your code. You’ll also have commented your code well. All this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to. As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python a much more pleasant task.Following PEP 8 is particularly important if you’re looking for a development job. Writing clear, readable code shows professionalism. It’ll tell an employer that you understand how to structure your code well.If you have more experience writing Python code, then you may need to collaborate with others. Writing readable code here is crucial. Other people, who may have never met you or seen your coding style before, will have to read and understand your code. Having guidelines that you follow and recognize will make it easier for others to read your code.By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:Write Python code that conforms to PEP 8Understand the reasoning behind the guidelines laid out in PEP 8Set up your development environment so that you can start writing PEP 8 compliant Python codeFollow the correct naming conventions for packages, modules, objects, classes variables and more.Implement the appropriate whitespacing between Python code componentsDevelop full scale professional Python projectsWho this course is for:Software Engineers that wish to improve their coding efficiencyComputer Science students that want to code professionallyAnyone with a desire to learn Python and PEP8]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn to create a complete Cybersecurity Framework from scratch with NIST Cybersecurity Guidelines  | Discount Coupon for Udemy Course]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This course will teach you how to use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework that provides a process that integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. The risk-based approach to control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations. Managing organizational risk is paramount to effective information security and privacy programs; the CSF approach can be applied to new and legacy systems, any type of system or technology (e.g., IoT, control systems), and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.NIST premised the entire Framework on the concept of risk management, which is “the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk,” an approach that provides a dynamic implementation of the Framework’s recommendations. The Framework consists of three parts: The Framework Core, the Framework Implementation, and the Framework Profile Tiers. The purpose of these three parts is to provide a “common language” that all organizations can use to understand, manage, and communicate their cybersecurity initiatives, both internally and externally, and can scale down or up to various parts of an organization as needed.The Framework Core is a set of activities aimed at organizing cybersecurity initiatives to achieve specific outcomes. The Core has five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.Section 2: Cybersecurity Risk Planning and Management: This section discusses how to establish knowledge of the systems in place and how to inform management of those systems’ risk profiles. We will also discuss how to develop plans for dealing with the highest priority risks. The goal is to help the students to develop an understanding necessary to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.Section 3: User and Network Infrastructure Planning and Management:This section provides a series of steps and tools to improve their organizations’ network infrastructure protection through improved asset access control, awareness and training, data security, protection policies, maintenance procedures, and automated protection processes.Section 4: Tools and Techniques for Detecting Cyber IncidentsThis section aims to help the students describe effective techniques for detecting cyber incidents or attacks, establish best approaches for monitoring systems to detect incidents, and plan for the development of organizational processes for detecting incidents.Section 5: Developing a Continuity of Operations PlanThis section will provide the reader with fundamental concepts and practical steps to respond to and recover from a cybersecurity incident. By the end of this section, the student will grasp the concepts necessary to develop an incident response plan (IRP), maintaining communications within the response team and the broader organization throughout an incident. The section will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of how to contain and mitigate an incident. Finally, the section will introduce the student to the basic principles and elements of developing a recovery plan and the importance of lessons learned in the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident.Section 6: Supply Chain Risk ManagementThis section will provide the student with an introduction to the complex and evolving supply chain risk management field.

Convertible bonds have the option, but not the obligation, for a bondholder to convert the bond to some number of stocks.The conversion feature in convertible securities makes them more difficult to value then other securities. For example, we can attempt to value a convertible bond by calculating the value of the related stock it could be converted into or by valuing bonds of a similar class which do not have a conversion option.Warrants are an option to buy a set number of shares of common stock at a specified price over a given time.Derivative securities are financial instruments whose value depends upon the value of another asset.

Our focus will be on capital markets.Capital markets help link up businesses that need money to expand with investors who would like to find a good investment for their money.Investment bankers often act as a middle person between the company issuing securities and the investors, the investment bankers taking on substantial risk as they play their role in the process. Investment bankers design and package securities, make offers, and sell to the public.Commercial banks differ from investment banks. Commercial banks usually deal with individuals and small companies. They generate revenue from interest on home mortgages and small business loans.Investment banks take much larger risks. They deal with large companies and high-risk startups. They act as a kind of bridge between the companies and the investors.Capital intensive industries often need debt financing to grow, the most common form being corporate bonds.We will compare and contrast debt financing and equity financing, discussing the pros and cons from the standpoint of the corporation and from that of the investor.Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.Dividends represent earnings that a corporation distributes to owners. Dividends for a corporation can be compared do withdrawals from a sole proprietorship or partnership. However, there are substantial differences between a partnership withdrawal and a corporate dividend due to differences in the business structure.A partner in a partnership generally has more control over the amount of draws they can take and when they can take them. Different partners may also draw different amounts at different times.By contrast, a corporation must give uniform distributions of dividends to each class of shares, resulting in far less direct control by an individual shareholder to determine the amount of dividends or when they will be distributed.The dividend distribution policy of a corporate can be very complex, involving many factors, including the life cycle of the company, the cash flow of the company, and the preferences of the shareholders.A company that is in the growth phase of its life cycle is more likely to have smaller dividends, preferring to reinvest the money to grow operations. Shareholders who would like to invest over a longer time frame may like this policy because the increase in value of the company will increase the value of the shares.A company in a mature phase of the life cycle may not have as much need to reinvest earnings and is more likely to distribute earnings to shareholders. Many investors like investing in dividend yielding companies because they receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends.Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

Both of these tools utilize time value of money concepts, and we will spend a lot of time with them.We will also discuss the payback period calculation and the modified internal rate of return or (MIRR).Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

This course will focus on equity financing. When considering equity financing, we can further break the financing options down into the two main categories of common stock and preferred stock, common stock being what we usually think of when considering equity financing.Common stock represents company ownership. Preferred stock has features related to both debt and common stock. Preferred stockholders do not have the same voting rights as the common stockholders. However, preferred stock generally has a priority claim to dividend distributions and a priority clam upon liquidation of the company when compared to common stock.We will also discuss the concepts of majority voting and cumulative voting. With regards to cumulative voting, we will consider calculations related to the number of shares required to be able to elect a certain number of board members and the calculation to determine the number of board members that can be elected given a set number of shares.The concepts related to majority voting and cumulative voting may be applicable in other setting as well, including politics and not for profit organizations.Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This course will discusses weighted average cost of capital, debt, and equity financing from a corporate finance perspective.We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.The general idea we want to keep in our mind is that businesses are looking to invest assets in order to receive a return. Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A career in software engineering is not the same as being good at coding. The field of software engineering has been evolving for decades. As the technology frontier gathers momentum, professionals must continuously re-calibrate to fit in, or they become obsolete even before they realize it. This trend is inevitable. But, Is it avoidable? Yes. Reinventing a career overnight is impossible but staying within a competing distance is possible. The answer is the same old boring strategy, planning. One has to define a flexible framework to tackle changing times. On the other hand, the efforts to get a great professional life might cost personal space. Is this trade-off mandatory? No. Understanding the skill set, market fit, and opportunity cost can help develop a practical career plan that doesn't overwhelm the personal life. A good career plan is a key to peace of mind in the chaotic universe of software. One doesn't have to plan every day of their career. One cannot keep boosting skills with certifications. Having periodic checkpoints and a set of goals to look forward to are a great start.Loans, pandemics, recessions, and many other factors will impede progress. A simple Plan B will ensure you have enough to start again. Not all plans need to work; just the fallback shouldn't fail. Software engineering is more about being human than about machines!**NOTE: All non-English captions are auto translatedOverviewSection 1: A quick overview of the software industry landscape.Section 2: A section dedicated to career planning for some aged 20-25Immediate challenges.Most probable role responsibilities.10 Immediately applicable action items5 things to avoidPointers to proactively choose transitionBook recommendations to enrich holistic perspective.Section 3: Dedicated section for professionals aged between 26-30ChallengesRole responsibilities10 Action items5 Don'tProactive transition pointersPersonal experience from this stageBook recommendationsSection 4: Dedicated to 31-35 years aged professionalsChallengesRole ResponsibilitiesAction itemsThings to avoidTransition pointersBook recommendationsSection 5: A perspective for 36+ years of professionalsChallengesDosDon'tsTransition pointersBook recommendationsSection 6: Closing remarksA perspective about managing the unsuccessful phases of interview processes.Key Takeaways:Understanding the software as a business hierarchy.Building a more holistic perspective around career.Learn to gauge competition and unpredictable factors at play.Starting kit to build a framework for future career planningSpecific and relevant Do's and Don't apply to all software engineering professionals irrespective of role, technologies, and geographies.What this course doesn't address:Interview strategies to crack any individual interviews.Short-term advice to get higher salaries.Any unsolicited advice to advance a career.Any biased opinion about a particular technology, framework, language, or company.Who this course is for:Software Engineers with 0-6 years of experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This course will cover the valuation of financial assets including bonds, common stock, and preferred stock.We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.The general concept used to value financial assets is to take the present value of future cash flows from the financial asset. Therefore, we will need to use present value concepts and calculations.The cash flow related to bonds will generally consist of a series of interest payments and a principal payment at maturity of the bond. We can use annuity calculations to determine the present value of the interest payments and present value of one calculation to determine the present value of principal at maturity.Preferred stock has characteristics similar to bonds in that the payments are often standardized. However, we do not have a maturity date as we do with bonds.Common stock can be more complex as we consider the future cash flow of dividends in an attempt to value the securities. The common stock dividends are more likely to change over time and we do not have a maturity date as we do with bonds.Who this course is for:Business studentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to experience "The Ultimate YouTube Advertising Course for Beginners" in 2022 created by Digital Marketing Legend "Srinidhi Ranganathan".As digital marketing expands and evolves, the tools we use to advertise ourselves must also develop. Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world. Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.Video marketing refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to "wake up" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.Did you know? By catching attention and driving demand at scale, video advertising may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. YouTube Video commercials that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brandIncreasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awarenessUsers are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was younger and decided to become a filmmaker I decided to come to London and study film at the university. Six months into my course I quit university when I realized that the information provided there was not sufficient for me to make a film. I was young, broke, and all I had was a dream, all I needed was the information and guidance.As times changed, I had to adapt to constantly changing technology. I learned a lot about filmmaking from the Internet, but there was one thing that I couldn't find online, and that is how to actually make my own film. A real film, a feature film. A film that I can share with the whole world. A film that I can watch on TV. I needed to find a way to make a film without relying on people donating their money for my film or without hurting friends and family by asking them to help me make my film.So that's what I did. I rolled my sleeves and jumped into self-education. As years went on I made mistakes, I improved, and I learned from my own failures. And this is what this course is all about. I know how important and how hard it is to make a feature film, but don't feel down. Let's make your movie and share it with the world.Who this course is for:Someone wanting to make a feature film by themselvesSomeone wanting to make a feature film with limited budget]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm an independent filmmaker and I know the importance of good looking poster for a film. Especially for independent films. Let me say the way it is, your movie poster is the deciding factor for the audience when deciding what to watch. As simple as that. It's beyond important. Imagine getting home from work, getting comfortable on a sofa in front of your tv, and scrolling through hundreds of tv shows and movies deciding what to watch. Subconsciously you will choose something that stands out from other films, and you will judge it by the poster. With years of making indie films and doing everything myself, I learned why my movies are not getting enough attention. That is not because of how good or how bad the movie is, sure it's important but it's not a deciding factor. In this course, you will learn how to design a great-looking film poster for a film that grabs attention and stands out among others. We will go through everything from doing research, finding suitable images for your poster, putting it all together, and much more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this course we will build an accounting system starting with a blank Excel worksheet, creating a general journal, a general ledger, a trial balance, subledgers, and financial statements.For each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps having been completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.Once we have created our accounting system worksheet, we will use it to record common transactions, entering the journal entries into the general journal, posting to the general ledger, creating the trial balance, adjusting the subsidiary ledgers, and constructing the financial statements.As we enter each transaction, we will consider the data input often used in accounting software like QuickBooks. Accounting software will use data input forms like bills, invoices, credit memos, checks, sales receipts, and more, to simplify the data input process, allowing users with little accounting experience to learn data input.Accountants are generally more valuable when they understand both the accounting theory, the impact on financial statements of each transaction, as well as how an accounting database program like QuickBooks works, including the data input forms used to enter normal financial transactions.Because spreadsheets are so transparent, they are the perfect tool to gain and understanding of both, accounting theory and accounting software.Conversely, building an accounting system in Excel is a great way, one of the best ways, to improve your Excel skills.Who this course is for:Accounting professionalsAnyone who wants to learn ExcelStudentsBusiness professionals]]></content:encoded>

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.Financial statements are the core tool we used to measure our current financial position as well as our past performance. The balance sheet and income statement are our major financial statements.The balance sheet shows us where we stand as of a point in time. The income statement looks back for a period of time, usually a month or year, to measure performance, discerning how we got to this current position represented by the balance sheet.Personal financial statements are similar to business financial statements but are less standardized. Personal financial statements are less standardized in part because there are fewer formal regulations restricting them and because our financial goals are different.The primary financial goal for a business is revenue generation. However, our personal financial goals will include, but not be limited to, revenue generation, the revenue being a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself.Learners will know how to construct financial statements and how the balance sheet and income statement are related.Once we have our financial statements, which map out past performance and our current position, we can use them as a basis to look forward, creating a budget.Learners well know how to construct a personal financial budget.

The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain’s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it’ principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injuryOur brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it’s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itselfAlthough related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neuronsNeuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.Who this course is for:Anyone who is interested in learning about neuroplasticityAnyone who is interested in learning how to rewire brain]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[CBT is an intensive, short-term, problem-oriented approach. It was designed to be quick, practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy. The focus of cbt is on the problems that come up in a person’s day-to-day life. cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience.Childhood experiences and events, while not the focus of cbt, may also be reviewed. This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life, and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to eventsAccording to cbt, the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itselfIn cbt, you learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations.By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset, you learn that the way you think can contribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. In cbt, you learn to reduce these emotional problems by: • identifying distortions in your thinking • seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts • “standing back” from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpointsFor cbt to be effective, you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts, beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exercises during sessions. For best results, you must also be willing to do homework between sessions.CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions. These include: • mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder • anxiety disorders, including specific phobias (fear of animals, heights, enclosed spaces), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder • bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder • body dysmorphic disorder (body image) • substance use disorders ( smoking, alcohol and other drugs).Who this course is for:Anyone who is interested in CBTAnyone who has the passion for learning]]></content:encoded>

After that, we will move on to create few REST API endpoints in our Springboot Application.Next we will move on to configure google console dashbaord to register our Springboot application.Then we will make a connection from our Springboot application with Google console.After that we will configure Spring Security in our Springboot application in such a way that only allowed endpoints will not need authentication. But for other endpoints user will be redirected to Google Authentication page.On Google Authentication page user will fill out its google credentials. If entered credentials are the correct user will be redricted to our Springboot Application.Now its time for us to create our frontend application and we will connect this frontend with our Springboot application.So user will now come to our Frontend, then he will login with google.On successful login we will fetch user information from google and show it to user on the next page.With Login with Google functionality we don't have to keep a seperate user database with us rather we can ask google to authenticate our user on our application's behalf. If successfully authenticated then google will give us all the profile information of the user.Using this information we can do further operation in our application.Who this course is for:Anyone who wants to integrate social login with google in their web application]]></content:encoded>

Our thoughts create our reality, the reality that we live in and spend the majority of our most valuable time. More importantly, the quality of your thinking determines the quality of your life. Our day-to-day thoughts create the beliefs that we process and these beliefs make us who we are (in a good way or in a bad way). Our thought process is actually something that we are engaged in every day of our lives, yet we always take it for granted without even acknowledging the fact that whatever we are doing and however we are feeling (emotionally) is totally dependent on our thought process and It is completely in our hand to make a difference in our life with our thinking pattern.Changing beliefs/thought processes isn’t easy.
